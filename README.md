## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

 - I want to develop an app namely **DiasporaConnect**, which will be a tool to link international students and immigrants to resources and a community. The app intends for users to connect with local cultural communities, resources, and events (dining locations, student organizations, religious institutions, legal-immigration services, etc.). Central aspects would include geo-targeted community forums, real-time listings for events, direct peer mentor connections, and a place where practical resources could be exchanged including housing, books, and cultural products. Rather than focusing on conventional social media interests, this app focuses on the ability to adapt culturally for the users and to communicate from a common community sense.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
 - I really didnt have any major issues. Only issue i did have was getting familiar with the xcode application. Once I got that, the rest things were pretty easy.
